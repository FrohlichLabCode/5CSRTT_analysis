function [evtSpkPLV,evtSpkAngle,meta] = is_spkPLV_MeanLFP(spkCell,evtTime,C_mean,lfpFs,f,twin,winSize, nSpks)
% This function computes spike phase locking across the entire recording,
% as well as the time-resolved spike phase locking around events of interest. 
% input:  spikeCell  - spike times in seconds across the whole session stored in a cell. Dimensions(1,channels/neurons)
%         evtTime    - event times across the whole session
%         Cmean      - The result of the convolution fo an lfp matrix with a
%                     complex Morlet wavelet. Dimensions(1,samples)
%         lfpFs     - LFP sample frequency
%         f         - index of frequency
%         regionChn - 
%         twin      - time window in seconds before and after event time
%         (eg. [-1 2] for 1 second before, 2 seconds after
%
% output: evtSpkAngle- time-resolved angle of the mean unit vectors (mean
%                       phase relationship for spikes 
%         evtSpkPLV  - The time-resolved spike-PLV computed around the
%                      timing of event. Dimensions(channels,time bins) 
%         numBins    - number of bins across the epoch of interest based on
%                       the sliding window step size
